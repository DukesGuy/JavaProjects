# Logger
Utilizing an interface in Java with two separate classes, AsteriskLogger and Spaced Logger. The log method on the AsteriskLogger prints out the String it receives between 3
asterisks on either side of the String (e.g. if the String passed in is “Hello”, then it should print *** Hello *** to the console). The error method on the AsteriskLogger should print the String it receives inside a box of
asterisks, with the String preceded by the word “ERROR:”. The SpacedLogger adds spaces between each character of the String argument
passed into its methods. If the log method received “Hello” as an argument, it should print H e l l o. The error method should do the same, but with “ERROR:” preceding the spaced out input
(i.e. ERROR: H e l l o).
